/**
 * If set, this activity will become the start of a new task on this

 * all of the activities inside of a particular task always remain in
 * the same order.  See
 * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/fundamentals.html#acttask">Application Fundamentals:
 * Activities and Tasks</a> for more details on tasks.
 *
 * <p>This flag is generally used by activities that want
 * to present a "launcher" style behavior: they give the user a list of
 * separate things that can be done, which otherwise run completely
 * independently of the activity launching them.
 *
 * <p>When using this flag, if a task is already running for the activity
 * you are now starting, then a new activity will not be started; instead,
 * the current task will simply be brought to the front of the screen with
 * the state it was last in.  See {@link #FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK} for a flag
 * to disable this behavior.
 *
 * <p>This flag can not be used when the caller is requesting a result from
 * the activity being launched.

 * a new task is <em>always</em> started to host the Activity for the
 * Intent, regardless of whether there is already an existing task running
 * the same thing.

/**
 * If set, and the activity being launched is already running in the
 * current task, then instead of launching a new instance of that activity,
 * all of the other activities on top of it will be closed and this Intent
 * will be delivered to the (now on top) old activity as a new Intent.
 *
 * <p>For example, consider a task consisting of the activities: A, B, C, D.
 * If D calls startActivity() with an Intent that resolves to the component
 * of activity B, then C and D will be finished and B receive the given
 * Intent, resulting in the stack now being: A, B.
 *
 * <p>The currently running instance of activity B in the above example will
 * either receive the new intent you are starting here in its
 * onNewIntent() method, or be itself finished and restarted with the
 * new intent.  If it has declared its launch mode to be "multiple" (the
 * default) and you have not set {@link #FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP} in
 * the same intent, then it will be finished and re-created; for all other
 * launch modes or if {@link #FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP} is set then this
 * Intent will be delivered to the current instance's onNewIntent().
 *
 * <p>This launch mode can also be used to good effect in conjunction with
 * {@link #FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK}: if used to start the root activity
 * of a task, it will bring any currently running instance of that task
 * to the foreground, and then clear it to its root state.  This is
 * especially useful, for example, when launching an activity from the
 * notification manager.

 * If D calls startActivity() with an Intent that resolves to the component
